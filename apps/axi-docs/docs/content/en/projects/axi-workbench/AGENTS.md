## 2026-08-07 Refresh Note

Project root `AGENTS.md` still owns the boundry SOP and six-layer authority. The dossier status reflects the v3 verified state.


# Axi Workbench — Agent Contract

> This dossier is the Axi Docs agent contract for **Axi Workbench** (workspace path: `/Volumes/code/workspace/projects/axi-workbench`).
> It does not replace the project root `AGENTS.md`. The project root always wins for project-local rules; this file only documents how Axi Docs *presents* the project.

## Read Order

1. This file (dossier).
2. `docs/content/{en,zh}/projects/axi-workbench/README.md` (dossier summary).
3. Project root `AGENTS.md` at `/Volumes/code/workspace/projects/axi-workbench/AGENTS.md`.
4. Project root `README.md` at `/Volumes/code/workspace/projects/axi-workbench/README.md`.

## Boundary

- Axi Docs treats this project as **read-only content source**.
- Axi Docs never edits files under `/Volumes/code/workspace/projects/axi-workbench`.
- Modifications must be proposed back to the owning project (PR, issue, or owner handoff).

## Update Cadence

- Re-run `pnpm --dir app projects:build` whenever `WORKSPACE_INDEX.md` changes.
- Hand-edit this dossier only when Axi Docs is the *primary* surface for the change (e.g. cross-project summary, MCP tool mapping).
