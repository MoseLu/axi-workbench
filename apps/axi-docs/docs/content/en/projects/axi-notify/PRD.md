## 2026-08-08 Refresh Note

Brought forward to match the workbench 2026-08 batch. Frontmatter refreshes `status: draft` -> `status: active`, `modified` -> `2026-08-08`. The body (REQs / Authoritative Documents / current state) keeps its existing content. Canonical project entry remains the project root AGENTS.md; subsequent batches bring the rest of the dossier body in line with each project's latest verified state. See `projects/axi-workbench/docs/audit/2026-08-08-axi-docs-axi-rules-staleness.md` for the cross-project freshness audit that motivated this pass.

# Axi Notify / Mobile — PRD Slice

> Axi Docs PRD slice for **Axi Notify / Mobile**. This is *not* the project PRD; it captures Axi Docs's own requirements for presenting this project.

## REQ-PROJ-AXI-NOTIFY-MOBILE-001

| Acceptance | `docs/content/{en,zh}/projects/axi-notify/README.md, AGENTS.md, INDEX.md, TODO.md, MILESTONE.md, PRD.md, TDD.md` exist with valid frontmatter. |
| Source | `WORKSPACE_INDEX.md` (workspace policy). |

## REQ-PROJ-AXI-NOTIFY-MOBILE-002

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |

## Non-Goals

- Axi Docs does not own the project; it only indexes it.
- Axi Docs does not duplicate the project's internal design, tests, or roadmap.
