description: Axi shared UI runtime layer (tokens + react + react-antd + react-addons). Drives the Axi Dashboard shell used by workbench, axiom-agent-platform, axiom-pet-desktop, axiom-pet, and axiom-image-preview. Refreshed against the 2026-08 workbench dual-app posture.

## 2026-08-08 Refresh Note

axi-ui sits underneath all Axi-om dashboards and the workbench shell. Two follow-up edges in the 2026-08 batch: a brand-new tools/axi-app-cli import dependency split, and the workbench @axi/shell upgrade to 0.3.0 / AxiTabActionMenu. This mirror notes those changes; canonical changelog is at the package root.


# Axi UI — TODO

> Dossier TODO. Tracks what Axi Docs still needs to surface for this project.

## P0

- [ ] Confirm project root `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` still exist and match `WORKSPACE_INDEX.md`.
- [ ] Surface canonical verification commands (read from project `AGENTS.md` or `package.json`).

## P1

- [ ] Capture first-party MCP tool mapping if the project exposes one (e.g. `axi_docs_*` adapters, `workspace-project` consumer).
- [ ] Link to active consumers via `workspace.graph.json` (`workspace-project consumers <id>`).

## P2

- [ ] Add a thumbnail or icon if the project is a Dashboard app.
- [ ] Cross-link to Axi Rules entry (`rules/<family>/AGENTS.md`) when behavior rules reference this project.

## Out of Scope

- Project-internal TODOs live in the project root, not here.
