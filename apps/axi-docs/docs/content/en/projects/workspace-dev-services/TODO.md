## 2026-08-08 Refresh Note

Brought forward to match the workbench 2026-08 batch. Frontmatter refreshes `status: draft` -> `status: active`, `modified` -> `2026-08-08`. The body (REQs / Authoritative Documents / current state) keeps its existing content. Canonical project entry remains the project root AGENTS.md; subsequent batches bring the rest of the dossier body in line with each project's latest verified state. See `projects/axi-workbench/docs/audit/2026-08-08-axi-docs-axi-rules-staleness.md` for the cross-project freshness audit that motivated this pass.

# Workspace Dev Services — TODO

> Dossier TODO. Tracks what Axi Docs still needs to surface for this project.

## P0

- [ ] Confirm project root `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` still exist and match `WORKSPACE_INDEX.md`.
- [ ] Surface canonical verification commands (read from project `AGENTS.md` or `package.json`).

## P1

- [ ] Capture first-party MCP tool mapping if the project exposes one (e.g. `axi_docs_*` adapters, `workspace-project` consumer).
- [ ] Link to active consumers via `workspace.graph.json` (`workspace-project consumers <id>`).

## P2

- [ ] Add a thumbnail or icon if the project is a Dashboard app.
- [ ] Cross-link to Axi Rules entry (`rules/<family>/AGENTS.md`) when behavior rules reference this project.

## Out of Scope

- Project-internal TODOs live in the project root, not here.
